# Forecasting-Canada-s-Crude-Oil-Production
A time series model for a country's Crude Oil Production Forecasting
Crude oil production forecasting is an important input into the decision-making process and investment scenario evaluation, which are crucial for oil-producing countries. Governments and businesses spend a lot of time and resources figuring out the production forecast that can help to identify opportunities and decide on the best way forward.
In this case study, we will analyze and use historical oil production data, from 1992 to 2018, for a country to forecast its future production. We need to build a time series forecasting model using the AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models in order to forecast oil production.
